# Analysis of Future-Based Find-All-If Implementation

## Overview

The future-based implementation uses std::future and std::async instead of raw threads for parallel processing. This analysis examines its performance characteristics and compares them with previous implementations.

   - Future implementation shows ~75% better maximum speedup

3. **Optimal Thread Count**

   - Both implementations perform best with 4 threads
