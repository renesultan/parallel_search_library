# Analysis of Hybrid Early Termination Implementation

## Overview

The hybrid early termination implementation combines size-based thread selection with early termination optimization, testing three scenarios:

1. Non-existent value search (worst case)
2. Beginning-of-array search (best case)
3. End-of-array search (near-worst case)

## Performance Analysis by Data Size

### Small Dataset (10,000 elements)
