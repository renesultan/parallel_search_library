Key Observation: Massive speedup potential with early termination on large datasets.

## Key Findings

1. **Early Termination Effect**

   - Parallel versions consistently find fewer numbers than serial version
   - This indicates successful early termination when first match is found
   - Results in dramatic performance improvements, especially for larger datasets

2. **Optimal Thread Count**

   - 4 threads consistently provides the best or near-best performance
   - Performance degradation observed beyond 8 threads
   - Thread overhead becomes significant with higher thread counts

3. **Scaling Characteristics**

   - Best speedup achieved with largest dataset (3,070x with 4 threads)
   - Diminishing returns with more than 4 threads
   - Thread overhead becomes more pronounced with smaller datasets

4. **Performance vs Dataset Size**

   - Small datasets (10K): 2-4 threads optimal
   - Medium datasets (100K): 4 threads optimal
   - Large datasets (1M+): 4 threads maintain optimal performance

## Performance Implications

1. **Thread Count Recommendations**

   - Default to 4 threads for general use
   - Consider 2 threads for datasets < 50K elements
   - Avoid using more than 8 threads due to diminishing returns

2. **Early Termination Benefits**

   - Early termination provides massive performance gains
   - Most effective on large datasets
   - Makes parallel search highly efficient for finding first occurrence

3. **Resource Utilization**

   - Thread overhead becomes significant beyond 8 threads
   - More threads ≠ better performance
   - Optimal thread count is independent of dataset size

## Comparison with Original Implementation

1. **Speedup Characteristics**

   - Find-all-if shows much higher speedups due to early termination
   - More consistent performance across different thread counts
   - Better scaling with larger datasets

2. **Thread Scaling**

   - Original implementation scaled better with more threads
   - Find-all-if performs best with fewer threads
   - Different optimal thread counts for different use cases

## Recommendations

1. **Implementation Choices**

   - Use early termination when searching for first occurrence
   - Limit thread count to 4 by default
   - Consider dynamic thread count based on dataset size

2. **Optimization Opportunities**

   - Implement thread pool to reduce thread creation overhead
   - Consider hybrid approach for very small datasets
   - Add configurable early termination option
