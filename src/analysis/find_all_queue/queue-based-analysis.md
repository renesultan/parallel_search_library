# Analysis of Queue-Based Find-All Implementation

## Overview

The queue-based implementation was tested with both integer and string vectors of varying sizes (10K to 10M elements), using different thread counts (2-16) and search positions (beginning, middle, end). The implementation includes both regular and early termination variants.
