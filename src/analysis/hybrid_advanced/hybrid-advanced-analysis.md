# Analysis of Hybrid Advanced Implementation

## Overview

The hybrid advanced implementation automatically selects between different parallelization strategies and thread counts based on data size:

- < 100K elements: 4 threads
- 100K-1M elements: 8 threads
- > 1M elements: 16 threads with thread pool

## Performance Analysis by Data Size
