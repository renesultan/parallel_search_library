# Analysis of Find-All-If Early Termination Implementation

## Overview

The predicate-based early termination implementation (`find_all_if_et`) was tested with different vector sizes (10K to 10M elements) and three types of predicates:

1. First even number (early match)
2. Number divisible by size/2 (mid-point match)
3. Number divisible by size (late match)

## Performance Analysis by Data Size

### Small Dataset (10,000 elements)

| Predicate Type | Serial (μs) | 2 Threads | 4 Threads | 8 threads | 16 Threads |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Early (Even)   | 9           | 122       | 128       | 237       | 419        |
| Middle (÷5000) | 149         | 178       | 189       | 206       | 376        |
| Late (÷10000)  | 297         | 199       | 181       | 283       | 382        |

Key Observations:

- Serial outperforms parallel for early matches
- Thread overhead significant for small datasets
- Inconsistent result count for early matches (1-2 occurrences)
- Linear degradation with thread count

### Medium Dataset (100,000 elements)

| Predicate Type | Serial (μs) | 2 Threads | 4 Threads | 8 threads | 16 Threads |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Early (Even)   | 2           | 65        | 108       | 190       | 360        |
| Middle (÷50K)  | 1,479       | 1,178     | 707       | 623       | 591        |
| Late (÷100K)   | 3,189       | 1,283     | 833       | 689       | 866        |

Key Observations:

- Parallel becomes advantageous for mid/late matches

| Middle (÷500K) | 15,175      | 11,366    | 5,637     | 4,744     | 2,585      |
| Late (÷1M)     | 131,901     | 11,570    | 6,460     | 4,644     | 4,815      |

Key Observations:

- Dramatic parallel advantage for mid/late matches

| Late (÷10M)    | 361,934     | 129,411   | 152,816   | 59,031    | 48,976     |

Key Observations:

- Massive parallel advantage for non-early matches

## Performance Patterns

### Position-Based Performance

1. **Early Match Characteristics**

   - Serial consistently outperforms parallel
   - Thread overhead dominates
   - Occasional inconsistent result counts
   - Parallel version not recommended

2. **Middle Match Characteristics**

   - Parallel significantly outperforms serial
   - Good scaling with thread count
   - Consistent result counts
   - Thread overhead well amortized

3. **Late Match Characteristics**

   - Maximum parallel advantage
   - Best scaling with thread count
   - Most predictable performance
   - Higher thread counts beneficial

### Thread Scaling Properties

1. **Early Matches**

   - Linear degradation with thread count
   - Overhead dominates any benefits
   - Not suitable for parallelization

2. **Middle Matches**

   - Good scaling up to 8-16 threads
   - Consistent performance improvement
   - Clear break-even points

3. **Late Matches**

   - Excellent scaling with higher thread counts
   - Best parallel speedup
   - Clear performance patterns

## Performance Implications

1. **Match Position Impact**

   - Early: Use serial implementation
   - Middle: Use 4-8 threads
   - Late: Use 8-16 threads

2. **Dataset Size Impact**

   - <100K: Consider serial for all cases
   - 100K-1M: Use 4-8 threads
   - > 1M: Use 8-16 threads

3. **Thread Count Selection**

   - Consider expected match position
   - Scale with dataset size
   - Balance overhead vs. parallelism

## Recommendations

1. **Implementation Selection**

   - Use serial for known early matches
   - Use parallel for unknown match positions
   - Consider hybrid approach for small datasets

2. **Thread Count Guidelines**

   - Small datasets: 2-4 threads
   - Medium datasets: 4-8 threads
   - Large datasets: 8-16 threads

3. **Optimization Opportunities**

   - Implement position-based thread allocation
   - Add adaptive thread count selection
   - Consider hybrid approach for mixed workloads

## Key Differences from Find-All Early Termination

1. **Performance Characteristics**

   - More pronounced position dependence
   - Higher thread overhead for predicates
   - More variable early termination behavior

2. **Scaling Properties**

   - Better scaling for late matches
   - More sensitive to thread count
   - Higher variability in results

3. **Implementation Considerations**

   - Predicate evaluation overhead
   - More complex synchronization needs
   - Higher impact of false sharing
